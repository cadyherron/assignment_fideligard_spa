===================
API

- use 'resolve' object to load as much data as we can, or spread out over a couple calls


- query for AAPL stock through Yahoo API:
    http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=
    select * from   yahoo.finance.historicaldata
             where  symbol    = "AAPL"
             and    startDate = "2014-12-21"
             and    endDate   = "2014-01-01"
    &format=json
    &diagnostics=true
    &env=store://datatables.org/alltableswithkeys
